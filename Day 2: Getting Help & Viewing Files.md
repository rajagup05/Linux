## Day 2: Getting Help & Viewing Files

**Goal:** Learn to read files and find help.

**Commands:** 

> **ls(list)** => The **ls** command is used to list information about files and directories in the current location.

> **ls -l** => Provides a long listing format, displaying detailed information like file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size in bytes, and last modification time.

> **ls -a** => Lists all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot .), which are normally excluded from standard view.

> **man(manual)** => The man command displays the on-screen user manual for any command or utility you specify.

> **cat** => The cat command is primarily used to display the entire content of a file directly in the terminal.

> **less** => The less command is a "pager" used to view file contents one page at a time, which is ideal for large files that would otherwise scroll past your screen with cat. 

**Lab:** View /etc/os-release with cat and /etc/passwd with less. Read the man page for ls.
