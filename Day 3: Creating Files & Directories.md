## Day 3: Creating Files & Directories

**Goal:** Learn to create files and folders.

**Commands:** 

> **mkdir(Make Directory)** => The mkdir command is used to create new directories (folders) in the file system. 
- `mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3`: Creates three directories simultaneously.

> **touch** => touch creates a new, empty file with that name. 
- `touch new_file.txt`: Creates a new, empty file named `new_file.txt` in the current directory. If `new_file.txt` already exists, its timestamp is updated.

> **nano(Nano Text Editor)** => nano is a user-friendly, command-line based text editor that comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions.
- `nano filename.txt`: Opens the file `filename.txt` for editing. If the file does not exist, nano opens a new buffer with that name, which is created upon saving.

**Lab:** Create a `MyTraining` directory, create `note1.txt` inside it, and use nano to write `"Hello World"`.
