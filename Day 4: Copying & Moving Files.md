## Day 4: Copying & Moving Files

**Goal: Learn to copy, move, and rename items.**

**Commands:** 

> cp (copy): The cp command is used to duplicate files or directories from one location to another, leaving the original intact.

eg.
- `cp file1.txt file2.txt` : Duplicates `file1.txt` and names the copy `file2.txt` in the current directory.
- `cp file.txt /home/user/Documents/` : Copies `file.txt` into the `/home/user/Documents/` directory with the same name.
- `cp file1.txt file2.txt backup/` : Copies `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into the `backup/` directory.
- `cp -r my_folder /home/user/backup/` : The -r (recursive) option is mandatory for copying entire directories and their contents.


> mv

**Lab:** Copy note1.txt to note1_copy.txt. Rename note2.txt to important.txt. Move all .txt files into a new Notes sub-directory.  Please acknowledge the message
