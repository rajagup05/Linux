## Day 6: Mid-Way Review Lab

## Goal: 

**Combine all skills from Days 1-5.**


## Lab: 

**Create a `ProjectA` folder with `src`, `docs`, and `logs` sub-folders. Create, copy, rename, and move files between them. Finally, delete the entire `ProjectA `directory.**

**Done:** 

1. used `pwd` to check current working directory.
2. used `ls` to list the availble files and folders.
3. used `mkdir ProjectA` to create this folder.
4. used `mkdir src docs logs` to create mutiple folders (3 folders in this case).
5. used `ls` to confirm the created folders.
6. used `touch docs/docs.txt` to create `docs.txt` in docs folder.
7. used `echo "this is docs txt file" > docs/docs.txt` to write this line in the `docs.txt` file.
8. used `cat docs/docs.txt` to see the contents of the file created.
9. used `cp docs/docs.txt logs/` to copy  the `docs.txt` into `logs/` folder.
10. used `ls logs/` to check if `docs.txt` is copied to this folder.
11. used `mv logs/docs.txt logs/logs.txt` to rename the `docs.txt` to `logs.txt`.
12. used `ls logs/` to confirm the changes.
13. used `mv logs/logs.txt src/` to move the `logs.txt` into `src/` folder.
14. used `ls src/` to confirm the changes.
15. used `ls logs/` to confirm if the file has successfully moved.
