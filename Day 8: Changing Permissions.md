## Day 8: Changing Permissions

**Goal:** Learn to change file permissions.

**Commands:** 

1. **chmod(both symbolic u+x and octal 755 methods):** The chmod command modifies the access permissions of files and directories for a certain user, group or others.

It supports two primary methods: symbolic and octal.

- Symbolic Method (Using Letters and Symbols):

- Octal Method (Using Numbers):


2. chown: 

**Lab:** Create script.sh. Use chmod u+x to make it executable. Create another file and set its permissions to 740 (rwx r-- ---).
